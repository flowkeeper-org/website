    <p>At the beginning we wanted to only add the <i>Tags</i> feature and improve automated test coverage. However, 
    while doing the latter, we identified a number of subtle, but important bugs in Import / Export mechanism, and 
    fixing them turned into a major codebase refactoring.</p>
    <p>We also decided to put the "resting" music back into the app, and made the sound output configurable.</p>
