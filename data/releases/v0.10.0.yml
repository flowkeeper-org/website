    <p>This version brings Flowkeeper even closer to the original Pomodoro Technique definition from Francesco Cirillo's book.
    Pomodoro interruptions are now handled as the book prescribes, and there is finally support for long breaks. One major
    deviation from the Technique in this version is the ability to track unfocused time. As usual there's a bunch of 
    quality-of-life improvements, bugfixes and better support for Linux.</p>

    title : "Pomodoro by the Book"
    content: |
      <p>I realized that what makes Flowkeeper better than other timers is that it sticks to Pomodoro Technique as Francesco
      Cirillo described in his book. And so I bought the latest edition, read it from A to Z, and tried to adjust Flowkeeper 
      behavior to match it as closely as possible. Here are some of the notable deviations:</p>
      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr><th>The Book</th><th>Flowkeeper</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr><td>You apply Pomodoro for "organizational activities" like meetings, emails and calls</td><td>You don't estimate such activities in pomodoros and track them as unfocused time instead (see below)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Pomodoro is marked completed when it rings, before its short break starts</td><td>Pomodoro is marked completed when its short break ends</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td>Short breaks are flexible, minimum 3 -- 5 minutes, up to 10 minutes</td><td>All short breaks have the same fixed duration (5 minutes by default)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Long breaks last 15 to 30 minutes (count down)</td><td>Long breaks can last indefinitely (count up)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>If you finish work within the first 5 minutes, just ignore it and start next pomodoro</td><td>You'd have to void such pomodoro</td></tr>
      <tr><td>There are two task lists -- To Do Today and Activity Inventory</td><td>There are Backlogs, which serve all planning purposes</td></tr>
      <tr><td>You track pomodoro statistics using Records Sheet</td><td>You use a combination of Pomodoro Health and Work Summary</td></tr>
      <tr><td>You specify activity type, e.g. "Writing" or "Condensing"</td><td>You use tags like #writing or #condensing</td></tr>
      <tr><td>You differentiate between internal and external interruptions by using different marks (' and -)</td><td>You can provide reasons for interruptions, which all produce the same ' marks</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Schedule / calendar takes precedence over Pomodoro</td><td>Scheduling is not supported (yet)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>You highlight the third estimate for retrospective purposes</td><td>Only the second estimate is displayed differently from the first</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Pomodoro timer produces two types of sounds -- it ticks and rings</td><td>Flowkeeper timer ticks, rings and plays music during short breaks</td></tr>

    title : "Tracking unfocused time"
    content: |
      <p>Some activities are not compatible with Pomodoro Technique, or simply do not require deep focus. At the same time,
      stuff like calls and meetings steals your productivity, so you'd still like to track those, just to know how much damage
      they do.</p>
      <p>Try to start a work item with no pomodoros -- this will automatically make it a time tracker.</p>
      <p>In Tracking mode Flowkeeper counts time up rather than down. You still get your progress indicator, but it functions
      as a wall clock rather than a kitchen timer.</p>
      <p>You can start / stop / restart tracking via Ctrl-S / ⌘-S.</p>
      <p>You can't mix focused (Pomodoro) and unfocused time tracking on the same work item. Also, unfocused time is not counted
      in Pomodoro Health (F9). Otherwise those Tracker items behave just like the normal Pomodoro ones. For example, they show
      up in the Work Summary (F3) and can be completed.</p>

    title : "Long breaks"
    content: |
      <p>Pomodoro Technique defines two types of breaks. The short ones keep you focused while you work on one task, while the
      long ones allows you to relax and help switching between tasks.</p>
      <p>Until now Flowkeeper only supported short breaks, ensuring that you are getting some minimal amount of rest between
      pomodoros needed for <a href="https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/focused-and-diffuse-thinking">switching between
      focused and diffused thinking modes</a>. And then it was up to you to decide when you need to take a longer break.</p>
      <p>In v0.10.0 Flowkeeper suggests you taking a long break after four completed pomodoros, as the Book prescribes.</p>
      <p>Unlike short breaks the long ones don't have predefined duration, and thus Flowkeeper displays elapsed time, not
      remaining. There's no music during long breaks. To end a break, you press Ctrl-S / ⌘-S, or click "Stop Tracking Time".</p>

    title : "Working in series"
    content: |
      <p>Some Flowkeeper users prefer their Pomodoro fully automated, i.e. next Pomodoro starting automatically after the short
      break ends. In this version it is implemented as an optional feature, which is disabled by default.</p>
      <p>The series stops if</p>
      <ul>
      <li>There are no more startable pomodoros in the current work item,</li>
      <li>You voided a Pomodoro,</li>
      <li>A long break started.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To enable working in series, go to Settings (F10) > Series and breaks.</p>

    title : "Moving items between backlogs"
    content: |
      <p>If you select a backlog and press Ctrl-M / ⌘-M, Flowkeeper will create a new backlog with a copy of incomplete work
      items from the one you selected.</p>
      <p>In addition to that, v0.10.0 also implements a way to <i>move</i> work items between backlogs. To move an item, just 
      drag it to a different list.</p>
      <p>It is useful for filling your daily task list with items from global backlogs, or to finish something you couldn't
      complete yesterday. This feature makes planning a breeze.</p>

    title : "Recording interruptions"
    content: |
      <p>Avoiding interruptions is the key aspect of Pomodoro Technique. The Book is very prescriptive about recording
      interruptions and doing retrospective analysis on those.</p>
      <p>Starting with v0.10.0 there's a new "Record Interruption" action when you click the timer widget or press Ctrl-T /
      ⌘-T. It allows you enter an optional note, and leaves a subtle tick mark ' next to the current Pomodoro.</p>
      <p>Voiding a Pomodoro records an interruption automatically.</p>

    title : "Import from GitHub [Beta]"
    content: |
      <p>Import from GitHub Issues is now available by pressing Ctrl-I / ⌘-I. It supports both public and private
      repositories.</p>
      <p>When you import from GitHub, you can choose to import metadata like assignee or issue state as #tags, so that you
      can filter by issue labels, for example.</p>
      <p>It is important to understand how consecutive imports merge with existing data:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Import creates a backlog with the name corresponding to GitHub org/repo, e.g. "flowkeeper-org/fk-desktop". If this
      backlog already exists, Flowkeeper will try to merge imported data with its content.</li>
      <li>If it finds a work item that starts with "[id] - [title]", it will consider it the same item. It will rename it,
      if you chose a different set of tags during the import, but it will not delete this item or create a duplicate. So,
      if you tracked some time or done some pomodoros on this item -- those will stay.</li>
      <li>It will create new items which don't exist yet.</li>
      <li>It won't touch completed items (they are sealed and can't be renamed anyway), and it will never delete anything.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you execute it against some large repository like facebook/react, this import will push Flowkeeper to its
      limits, mainly because of hundreds of new tags. If you uncheck tags creation or disable tags altogether in Settings >
      General > Display #tags, Flowkeeper will handle even thousands of tasks without breaking a sweat.</p>

    title : "Import from CSV [Beta]"
    content: |
      <p>Import from CSV is now available by pressing Ctrl-I / ⌘-I. You can choose the field delimiter, as well as specify
      that your CSV has headers. The CSV file <i>must</i> have three columns -- backlog name, work item name, and work item
      state ("new" or "completed").</p>
      <p>It is important to understand how consecutive imports merge with existing data:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Import creates backlogs corresponding to the first column in the file. If a backlog with this name already exists --
      it will be reused.</li>
      <li>If it finds an existing backlog / work item combination, it will leave it as-is, except if you marked it as completed
      in the CSV file -- then it will complete the corresponding item in Flowkeeper.</li>
      <li>If you rename something in the CSV and re-import, Flowkeeper will create new items. It won't rename existing items.
      If you delete rows from CSV, the import will simply ignore it.</li>
      <li>It won't touch completed items (they are sealed and can't be renamed anyway), and it will never delete anything.</li>
      </ul>

    title : "Flowkeeper on Flathub"
    content: |
      <p>Starting with v0.10.0 you can install Flowkeeper from 
      <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.flowkeeper.Flowkeeper">Flathub</a>, both for x86 and ARM architectures:</p>
      <pre>$ flatpak install flathub org.flowkeeper.Flowkeeper
      $ flatpak run org.flowkeeper.Flowkeeper</pre>
      <p></p><p>The application is securely sandboxed and works through XDG Desktop Portals, which was tested on GNOME and KDE.
      On Flatpak-friendly distros like openSUSE you can also find it in KDE Discover.</p>
      <p>One great thing about Flatpak is that it will keep your Flowkeeper up to date.</p>

      Service</a> I can now provide Flowkeeper repos for most of the mainstream Linux distributions, starting with 
      openSUSE Tumbleweed. To install Flowkeeper execute:</p>
      <pre>$ zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:
      /flowkeeper/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:flowkeeper.repo
      $ zypper install flowkeeper</pre>
      <p></p><p>Support for Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora repos is coming soon! It will become the recommended way to install
      Flowkeeper on Linux.</p>

    title : "Flowkeeper CLI [Beta]"
    content: |
      <p>All Flowkeeper installers now bundle <code>fk</code> binary, which you can use to query and modify Flowkeeper 
      file database. As of v0.10.0 it only works with Backlogs.</p>
      <p>Try <code>fk backlog --help</code> to see what you can do with it. The most impressive results can be obtained
      by enabling file watching in Flowkeeper (Settings (F10) > Connection > Watch changes). Then, every time you make
      a change via CLI, your running Flowkeeper application will pick it up immediately.</p>
      <p>It is still in experimental state and is not added to the PATH automatically. In the future releases I
      shall extend its functionality to support work items, timer state, import/export, statistics, and more.</p>
