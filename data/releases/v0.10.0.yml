    <p>This version brings Flowkeeper even closer to the original Pomodoro Technique definition from Francesco Cirillo's book.
    Pomodoro interruptions are now handled as the book prescribes, and we introduced support for long breaks. One major
    deviation from the Technique in this version is the ability to track unfocused time. As usual there's a bunch of minor
    quality-of-life improvements, bugfixes and better support for Linux.</p>

    title : "Tracking unfocused time"
    content: |
      <p>Some activities are not compatible with Pomodoro Technique, or simply do not require deep focus. At the same time,
      stuff like calls and meetings steals your productivity, so you'd still like to track those, just to know how much damage
      they do.</p>
      <p>Try to start a work item with no pomodoros -- this will automatically make it a time tracker.</p>
      <p>In Tracking mode Flowkeeper counts time up rather than down. You still get your progress indicator, but it functions
      as a wall clock rather than a kitchen timer.</p>
      <p>You can start / stop / restart tracking via Ctrl-S / ⌘-S.</p>
      <p>You can't mix focused (Pomodoro) and unfocused time tracking on the same work item. Also, unfocused time is not counted
      in Pomodoro Health (F9). Otherwise those Tracker items behave just like the normal Pomodoro ones. For example, they show
      up in the Work Summary (F3) and can be completed.</p>

    title : "Long breaks"
    content: |
      <p>Pomodoro Technique defines two types of breaks. The short ones keep you focused while you work on one task, while the
      long ones allows you to relax and help switching between tasks.</p>
      <p>Until now Flowkeeper only supported short breaks, ensuring that you are getting some minimal amount of rest between
      pomodoros needed for <a href="https://modelthinkers.com/mental-model/focused-and-diffuse-thinking">switching between
      focused and diffused thinking modes</a>. And then it was up to you to decide when you need to take a longer break.</p>
      <p>In v0.10.0 Flowkeeper suggests you taking a long break after four completed pomodoros, as the Book prescribes.</p>
      <p>Unlike short breaks the long ones don't have predefined duration, and thus Flowkeeper displays elapsed time, not
      remaining. There's no music during long breaks. To end a break, you press Ctrl-S / ⌘-S, or click "Stop Tracking Time".</p>

    title : "Working in series"
    content: |
      <p>Some Flowkeeper users prefer their Pomodoro fully automated, i.e. next Pomodoro starting automatically after the short
      break ends. In this version we implemented it as an optional feature, which is disabled by default.</p>
      <p>The series stops if</p>
      <ul>
      <li>There are no more startable pomodoros in the current work item,</li>
      <li>You voided a Pomodoro,</li>
      <li>A long break started.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To enable working in series, go to Settings (F10) > Series and breaks.</p>

    title : "Moving items between backlogs"
    content: |
      <p>If you select a backlog and press Ctrl-M / ⌘-M, Flowkeeper will create a new backlog with a copy of incomplete work
      items from the one you selected.</p>
      <p>In addition to that, in v0.10.0 we also implemented a way to <i>move</i> work items between backlogs. To move an
      item, just drag it to a different list.</p>
      <p>It is useful for filling your daily task list with items from global backlogs, or to finish something you couldn't
      complete yesterday. This feature makes planning a breeze.</p>

    title : "Recording interruptions"
    content: |
      <p>Avoiding interruptions is the key aspect of Pomodoro Technique. The Book is very prescriptive about recording
      interruptions and doing retrospective analysis on those.</p>
      <p>Starting with v0.10.0 there's a new "Record Interruption" action when you click the timer widget or press Ctrl-T /
      ⌘-T. It allows you enter an optional note, and leaves a subtle tick mark ' next to the current Pomodoro.</p>
      <p>Voiding a Pomodoro records an interruption automatically.</p>

    title : "Import from GitHub [Beta]"
    content: |
      <p>Import from GitHub Issues is now available by pressing Ctrl-I / ⌘-I. It supports both public and private
      repositories.</p>
      <p>When you import from GitHub, you can choose to import metadata like assignee or issue state as #tags, so that you
      can filter by issue labels, for example.</p>
      <p>It is important to understand how consecutive imports merge with existing data:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Import creates a backlog with the name corresponding to GitHub org/repo, e.g. "flowkeeper-org/fk-desktop". If this
      backlog already exists, Flowkeeper will try to merge imported data with its content.</li>
      <li>If it finds a work item that starts with "[id] - [title]", it will consider it the same item. It will rename it,
      if you chose a different set of tags during the import, but it will not delete this item or create a duplicate. So,
      if you tracked some time or done some pomodoros on this item -- those will stay.</li>
      <li>It will create new items which don't exist yet.</li>
      <li>It won't touch completed items (they are sealed and can't be renamed anyway), and it will never delete anything.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you execute it against some large repository like facebook/react, this import will push Flowkeeper to its
      limits, mainly because of hundreds of new tags. If you uncheck tags creation or disable tags altogether in Settings >
      General > Display #tags, Flowkeeper will handle even thousands of tasks without breaking a sweat.</p>

    title : "Import from CSV [Beta]"
    content: |
      <p>Import from CSV is now available by pressing Ctrl-I / ⌘-I. You can choose the field delimiter, as well as specify
      that your CSV has headers. The CSV file <i>must</i> have three columns -- backlog name, work item name, and work item
      state ("new" or "completed").</p>
      <p>It is important to understand how consecutive imports merge with existing data:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Import creates backlogs corresponding to the first column in the file. If a backlog with this name already exists --
      it will be reused.</li>
      <li>If it finds an existing backlog / work item combination, it will leave it as-is, except if you marked it as completed
      in the CSV file -- then it will complete the corresponding item in Flowkeeper.</li>
      <li>If you rename something in the CSV and re-import, Flowkeeper will create new items. It won't rename existing items.
      If you delete rows from CSV, the import will simply ignore it.</li>
      <li>It won't touch completed items (they are sealed and can't be renamed anyway), and it will never delete anything.</li>
      </ul>

    title : "Running external programs"
    content: |
      <p>There were several requests to think about Flowkeeper integration with external tools like diaries and
      note-taking apps. In 0.9.0 I addressed this demand via configurable "Integration" feature.</p>
      <p>You can make Flowkeeper run an external program whenever something happens. You can pick from a variety 
      of Flowkeeper events, like "FileEventSource.AfterWorkitemCreate" or even "WorkitemTableView.AfterSelectionChanged".</p>
      <p>You can use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_string_formatting.asp">Python f-string placeholders</a>, e.g. {workitem.get_name()} or even {dir()}.</p>

      <p>By pressing F3 you can access Work Summary, which received some major improvements in version 0.9.0.</p>
      <p>New output formats: Markdown table, Emacs Org mode, JSON and XML.</p>
      <p>You can also filter by the reporting period. For example, "Previous week" works well if you are preparing
      your timesheets on Monday.</p>
      <p>The default action in the "Work Summary" window is "Copy summary to clipboard and close". Also, it remembers 
      last settings, so that if you use it routinely, you can simply press F3 -> Enter and get all your needed 
      data in the clipboard in just two simple keystrokes.</p>
