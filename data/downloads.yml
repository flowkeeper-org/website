  We build Flowkeeper automatically thanks to GitHub Pipelines.
  Flowkeeper is Open Source software, so you can <a href="https://github.com/flowkeeper-org/fk-desktop#building">build it from source</a> yourself.
  You can also find <a href="https://github.com/flowkeeper-org/fk-desktop/releases">previous releases</a> in GitHub.
