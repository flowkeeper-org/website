    <p>In November I received a bunch of useful feedback from people using Flowkeeper. In this release I tried to address 
    as much of it as I could, as well as implement the "reordering" feature, which I wanted to do since ages.</p>

    title : "Configurable timer widget"
    content: |
      <p>You can now choose between two timer widgets -- "Classic" and "Minimalistic".</p>
      <p>This configuration wizard is shown when you launch Flowkeeper for the first time. After that, the timer
      look-and-feel can be configured in Settings > Appearance > Focus bar flavor.</p>

    title : "Configurable tray icon"
    content: |
      <p>The tray icon is now configurable, too. Some users asked for a monochrome version, which I called "Thin".
      Unfortunately, Qt doesn't provide a way to detect tray background color, so you need to choose between light
      and dark mode yourself.</p>
      <p>This configuration wizard is shown when you launch Flowkeeper for the first time. After that, the timer
      look-and-feel can be configured in Settings > Appearance > Tray icon flavor.</p>

    content: |
      <p>In Minimalistic timer mode you can access Pomodoro actions via a context menu by clicking on the timer.</p>
      <p>The Classic timer mode works the same way as before, without a menu.</p>

    title : "Running external programs"
    content: |
      <p>There were several requests to think about Flowkeeper integration with external tools like diaries and
      note-taking apps. In 0.9.0 I addressed this demand via configurable "Integration" feature.</p>
      <p>You can make Flowkeeper run an external program whenever something happens. You can pick from a variety 
      of Flowkeeper events, like "FileEventSource.AfterWorkitemCreate" or even "WorkitemTableView.AfterSelectionChanged".</p>
      <p>You can use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_string_formatting.asp">Python f-string placeholders</a>, e.g. {workitem.get_name()} or even {dir()}.</p>

    title : "Journaling-friendly Work Summary"
    content: |
      <p>By pressing F3 you can access Work Summary, which received some major improvements in version 0.9.0.</p>
      <p>New output formats: Markdown table, Emacs Org mode, JSON and XML.</p>
      <p>You can also filter by the reporting period. For example, "Previous week" works well if you are preparing
      your timesheets on Monday.</p>
      <p>The default action in the "Work Summary" window is "Copy summary to clipboard and close". Also, it remembers 
      last settings, so that if you use it routinely, you can simply press F3 -> Enter and get all your needed 
      data in the clipboard in just two simple keystrokes.</p>

    title : "Single Flowkeeper instance"
    content: |
      <p>There's a new setting to prevent multiple Flowkeeper instances from running. If it is enabled, nothing will
      happen when you try to launch the second Flowkeeper instance.</p>
