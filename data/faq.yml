questions:
  - q: Why Another Pomodoro Timer?
    a: |
      Unlike other timers on the market, Flowkeeper is designed to be: a). Free Software; b). Cross-platform; c). Work natively on a Desktop. It is not just a Pomodoro timer, but a robust, open and secure work tracking platform.
  - q: How can I synchronize my data across all my devices?
    a: |
      As of version 0.7.x, Flowkeeper only works offline. We are actively developing real-time data sync, so stay tuned. End-to-end encryption and data security is our primary focus at the time. Also, providing a free public server for a GPL project is a challenge in itself. As for now, you can manually share your data file via the likes of Dropbox, OneDrive or rclone. You can find the filename in Settings > Connection. There you can also enable "Watch changes" option, then Flowkeeper will sync events across all your devices in near real-time. This "offline" mode will be supported in all future versions of Flowkeeper, and you'll be able to upload this data to the server, once the "online" mode is released.
  - q: Is there a mobile version?
    a: |
      We are working on a Progressive Web App (PWA) version of Flowkeeper as part of implementing the server. The beta version without the timer, which only supports task management features, will be released together with the "online" mode feature.
  - q: How does it compare to XYZ app?
    a: |
      We know we should create a proper table for it, but as for now, compared to a typical Pomodoro timer, Flowkeeper: a). Supports a wider range of desktop operating systems, including diverse Linux environments; b). Is more lightweight and performant (it's not based on Electron, and we routinely test it on a Core 2 Duo machine); c). Has portable versions and does not require admin rights to install; d). Is optimized for power users (keyboard shortcuts and rich set of settings); e). Has open source and is free as Freedom; f). Does NOT synchronize data across devices; g). Does NOT have a mobile version; h). Is NOT translated to multiple languages;
  - q: Is it really free?
    a: |
      Yes, it is totally free, and is distributed under the terms of GPL license, similar to Linux Kernel or Git. There is neither a paid version, nor paid features. You can sponsor the project on GitHub -- all funds will go into future Flowkeeper Server infrastructure.
  - q: When I launch Flowkeeper installer, Windows says that it is signed by Vilia SARL. What is it?
    a: |
      Vilia SARL (vilia.fr) is an industrial consulting company owned by Constantine Kulak, Flowkeeper's author. We use an EV certificate issued to Vilia for signing our Windows binaries. Without it Windows would block Flowkeeper installation, complaining about executing unverified software downloaded from Internet.
  - q: Is my data safe? What about privacy?
    a: |
      We take user privacy seriously. Unless we are 200% sure all your data is end-to-end encrypted, we won't be enabling online data sync in Flowkeeper. You might have noticed that this site doesn't have a Cookies banner -- it's because we don't even use cookies for tracking you. The only network calls Flowkeeper makes in version 0.7.x are to check if updates are available. It uses GitHub API, which does not provide us any tracking information. You can disable those checks in the Settings, if you wish.
  - q: How can I report a bug or request a feature?
    a: |
      Please file an Issue on our GitHub page: https://github.com/flowkeeper-org/fk-desktop/issues. Thank you!
  - q: I switched to Flatpak, and I don't see my data anymore. How to get it back?
    a: |
      Flatpak apps are sandboxed and get their own copy of configuration files. Go to Settings > Connection > Browse... and select your old data file.
      The file picker is aware of Flatpak, and automatically grants Flowkeeper access to selected file outside of its sandbox. By the way, that's why
      all file input boxes are grayed out when we run in a sandbox, as you have to use file pickers.
